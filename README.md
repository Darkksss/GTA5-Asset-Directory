**AS OF JANUARY 16, 2026, I'M TYPING UP ANYTHING RELATED TO GTAO STARTING WITH FEMALE ASSETS MOVING TO MALE AFTER.**

TOTAL SIZE: 41.3KB


**NOTES ABOUT DIFFUSE TEXTURES:**
- These textures get swapped out depending on the color of that piece of clothing. For example, the black bikini doesn't swap models, the texture just gets swapped.


## TYPES OF FILES WITHIN GTAV
**GTAV contains a lot of files but here are some files and from my understanding what they are:**

**ROOT\:** *".rpf"*: Rage Package Files contains data related to the game. These are basically the root files like how your "C:\" is the root of your system files.

**L2\:** *".ymt"*: These are like HTML files but define game attributes. These unlike binary files are easy to read for humans.

**L2\:** *".xml"*: Like YMT files, these are also easy to read. These use tags to define and structure data.

**L2\:** *".meta"*: These like YMT and XML files are also easy to read. These can act as instructions or map to handle data.
